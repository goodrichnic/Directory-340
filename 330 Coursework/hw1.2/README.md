#  For this week's assignment I drew up a Japanese macaque. I was inspired by going to see the movie Kubo and the Two Strings.
I drew it up first in Illustrator on a 700px X 700px Canvas. Finding the anchor points' coordinates was the only tedious thing
I had to accomplish. But the face of a macaque was very friendly to using simple geometric shapes I could comprehend this far
into our exploration of P5.js.

##  An interesting component of doing this was combining seperate shapes into one larger one by elminating stroke and keeping hex codes consistent between several shapes. 
  
  In the future I think it'd be interesting to find out if there are other ways of merging
  shapes so they could potentially create one larger shape and have a stroke around the larger final product. I suppose this could be
  accomplished via duplicates of one merging shape layering another merging object,the one on bottom with stroke, and the one on top without.
  
    I finished this assignment much quicker than I expected to. I didn't seem to expreience a lot of trouble, and I'm satisfied
    with my results. The codes is fun and the reference page makes learning it so much more accessible than js was to me previuosly.
    The only question I have thus far is:
      -How much of this P5.js code is applicable to real world javascript apps?
