#Blog Entry 3.2

  This week I wanted to make a circle that I could start and stop moving along the x-axis with a button. 
  Making the button was a fun and mostly straight-forward project. I hope to find a quicker way to make several buttons at once.
  My idea mostly came to light except for stopping the circle dead in its tracks. I'd like for it to stop wherever it lies.
  However I could not find ways to store the constantly changing x-variable in a way that would stop the ball in its tracks. I compromised and made the ball start over from zero every time.
  
  Making the button's text change from STOP to START took a long time as well. I originally tried to mae it an if/else statement. This did not work out like I hoped, because once one statement was true, they both remained true and I could see both text elements on top of one another. 
  My solution was to make both text elements into boolean variables! Now once the mouse is clicked it is alternately switching on/off my text elements "STOP" and "START".
