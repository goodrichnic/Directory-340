#Pac-Man Blog

This project was really difficult. We approached a lot of things we covered and applied them in new and interesting ways.
I still don't have it done quite right, however, I feel like I've learned more about the thinking style programmers need to have to operate at a high capacity than in any other week's assignment. 

I thought it was really exciting when I made the things we worked on in class work on my own. Seeing those concepts come to life in the form of the (adorable?) pac-man character made me excited to continue working in this field. 

Building the Pac-Man class was the easy part. I want to learn more about the PI functions so I could be more successful than I was in making the pac-menmove their mouths. 

The for loop to insert several pac-men initially proved difficult purely because I had one simple code concept wrong. I was calling a "class.function" method in the setup of the sketch file and I learned after several days of zero functionality that one can not reference their constructor method until the draw loop. 

As far as making the pac-men move and interact with eachother went I was at a standstill for about 3 days. 

The north/south/east/west problem became my first problem because, again, I need to know about the PI functions more in approaching situations like that. 

I started looking at the example code to figure out what was needing to happen and found myself falling into logical holes. For a while I didn't understand the code, then I started to slowly implement it in my own program. I was starting to follow along and understand what was happening when out of the blue I used the wrong variable for the wrong function for about 1 day and reached an emotional peak. I didn't realize I was using the wrong variable until Wednesday right before class. I cam into office hours and realized I was on a good track until that fatal accident. I think a possible solution for things like this might be to keep a notepad next to me for when I'm solving the sub-problems.
