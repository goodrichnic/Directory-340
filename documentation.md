#Blog Entry Assignment 2.1
##Simple Animation Loops

  This assignment was a little tougher than last week's. I wanted to never stop exploring, however once my file was disgustingly
  filled with variables I had to slow myself down because I had errors popping up left and right, and I was referring to 
  commands far beyond my basic understanding of js. 
  
  Yeah, I found myself playing with commands in the reference page just for the fun of it. 
  
      However I found quite a few errors in my code which I haven't been able to resolve. I've made notes in my project file.
      Despite that I managed to turn in something cool, and sufficient.
