# Create Your Own Adventure
#### Please!

This was a very challenging assignment for me. I found myself perplexed by every new DOM command. It's possibly due to my poor attendance lately. However I really wanted to make this into a bigger project but was greatly hindered by the DOM's complexity. I remember having trouble with the DOM last semester as well. I may need to sit down at some point with Michael and talk about DOM stuff. Where I finally drew the line was when I wanted to change a tag from a <button> to an <input>.

        function nextThree() {
     document.getElementById("text").innerHTML = "But before you decide what to do first: WHAT IS YOUR NAME?!";
     // Trying to eliminate button and change it to a text box
     document.getElementbyTag("input").setAttribute = ("button", "text");
        }
        
I accidentally spent a whole day working on this and have nothing to show for it. In the future I will probably seeka an alternate method or solution around problems which prove to be this...problematic.    

### Thanks
