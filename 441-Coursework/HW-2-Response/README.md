# Countdown Timer

This is my first program in plain old native HTML/DOM Javascript and not p5.js. Some of the references and prefixes took me a little while to comprehend and get used to working though.

Specifically:

     document.getElementById("counter").textContent = count;

Applying this to the HTML and actually seeing results took some serious fidgeting to work with. I used getElementByID (Capital "ID") at one point and nothing was working!

Overall I see the massive potential of javascript more than ever before. The id and class variables can be used as powerful organizational and stylistic tools. The use of scope in this was pretty interesting as well, I never considered scope in HTML. I got to experiment with it by changing elements background-colors with js id tags.

I think the only thing I would like to do more to this is add a button to initiate the countdown.
