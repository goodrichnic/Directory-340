#Final Project Proposal

##LET'S BUILD A SYNTHESIZER

As a sonic artist and musician I've always wanted to build instruments. I've never worked well with acoustics and physical engineering. However, I've made instruments before via sampling (cheating?) for a high school project I made a piano out of bananas and from that point I started experimenting more and more with midi and began my introductory sampling instruments. I've been exploring and experimenting with the sound library in p5 since last week and want to do a dedicated sound project. 

Careers in the digital instrument field are multiplying as sample libraries and synthesizer presets, and digital plugins become more and more popular as "studios as instruments" become more and more common. 

###Sub-Problems
####Constructing an Interface:
A keyboard with black and white keys has 2 different shapes to be made into an array of several within an octave. Each has to be a button not interfering with the two shapes right beside it; rectangles on top of each other. Above the keyboard will be "knobs" to adjust custom variables based on sound elements parts and pieces. Adjustable variables will be a filter with a frequency selector, a dedicated pitch changer,  

####Selecting Sounds:
I'm going to have to go back and research traditional tuning math and adjust each key to be the note it aligns with as a keyboard. Timbre will be decided via a waveform selector.

#####Dream Big
 If I have the time and resources I'd like to make this midi compatible in-browser.
