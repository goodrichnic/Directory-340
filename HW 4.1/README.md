###This week I only wanted to work with one function in order to grasp the function as variables concept. I had a hard time understanding what i could and could not put inside a function before recalling it in the fraw function. I forgot about calling the functions after they're defined. I see now that we need to declare the function, and then run it in the draw loop. It will not run in its own loop, especially if its within an object variable.
