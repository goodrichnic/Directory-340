#This is Monochroma
I've built a simple monophonic synthesizer with and oscillator triggered by user input via mouse clicks. Featuring a chromatic scale, this has been a fun, and eye-opening project exposing myself to how much coding logic I understand and how a digital synthesizer might function. A good chunk of my time, unfortunately, went to simply making sure my adjustable parameters functioned properly and could be interacted with realistically. I've achieved that goal with my knobs. They twist as the user clicks and drags on the y-axis, and operate on a realistic zero to one scale. My faders are little buggy, but if you catch them right at the bottom of their range, they adjust beautifully and crisply. All values are being manipulated on either a (-1) to 1 scale, offering low,mid, and high extremes, or from a 0-1 range , offering an infinite set of output values.
###Monochroma has a lot of work to be done it including:
- Oscilators as variables
- realistic keyboard display
- QWERTY playability
- Extra audio effects
- Stylization
